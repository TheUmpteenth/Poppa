Bubble Popper


This is a unity project using 2020.3.1f1 (LTS)

It's a simple bubble popper game, initially only for use in the editor, but with a view to porting to iOS and Android.

I've chosen to make this using the 2D pack within unity, and Text Mesh Pro, since these are flexible and robust 2D tools

The simple, 80s retro neon style is used just because it's easy to achieve with little art ability.

Known isses

- There's no concept of building an intial level
- Horizontal attachment is flaky at best
- There's nothing to force the type selection to facilitate a win
- There are no pools
